## Ruby Linked List for TOP

This is my very first implementation of the linked list!

It comes with some cool methods, such as:

- #append -> *appends* a new node to the beginning of the list.
- #prepend -> *prepends* a new node to the end of the list.
- #size -> Returns the length of the list.

- #at(idx) -> Returns node value at idx.
- contains?(value) -> Returns true if any node matches value

And many more!
